## Flight Fare Prediction — Machine Learning with Python

This project demonstrates my ability to build and evaluate a machine learning model for predicting airline ticket prices using Python and key data science libraries. It involves hands-on experience with **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, **EDA**, and **regression modeling**—skills highly relevant for any data-driven role.

### Objectives

- Predict airline ticket prices based on features like airline, source/destination, time, and duration
- Apply data preprocessing techniques to prepare raw input for model training
- Build interpretable models that offer practical insight into fare variability

### Key Steps

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, converted categorical variables, engineered useful features like journey time and day of travel
- **EDA & Visualization:** Discovered pricing trends using **Matplotlib**, identifying impact of flight duration, stops, and airline
- **Model Development:** Trained and tuned regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to accurately predict fares
- **Model Evaluation:** Measured performance using MAE/RMSE and tested model generalizability
